Question 5:-  Write a short note on tab index.
Answer 5:-  The tabindex attribute is a global attribute in HTML that specifies whether an element can be focused using the Tab key.

A tabindex value of 0 makes an element focusable. A tabindex value of -1 makes an element unfocusable. A tabindex value of greater than 0 makes an element focusable and specifies the order in which it will be focused when the Tab key is pressed.

Elements with a tabindex value of 0 or greater are also considered to be part of the document's tab order. This means that they will be included when the user tabs through the document using the Tab key.

Elements with a tabindex value of -1 are not considered to be part of the document's tab order. This means that they will not be included when the user tabs through the document using the Tab key.

The tabindex attribute is important for accessibility. It allows users to navigate through a web page using the keyboard, which is important for users who cannot use a mouse or who have difficulty using a mouse.

Here are some of the benefits of using the tabindex attribute:

* Improves accessibility: The tabindex attribute can help to improve the accessibility of a web page by making it easier for users to navigate the page using the keyboard.
* Increases usability: The tabindex attribute can also help to increase the usability of a web page by making it easier for users to find and interact with the elements on the page.
* Improves SEO: Search engines can also use the tabindex attribute to index the content of a web page, which can help to improve the page's ranking in search results.
* Here are some of the best practices for using the tabindex attribute:

* Use a tabindex value of 0 for all elements that should be focusable.
* Use a tabindex value of -1 for elements that should not be focusable.
* Use a positive tabindex value for elements that should be focusable and specify the order in which they should be focused.
* Use the tabindex attribute consistently throughout your web pages.
